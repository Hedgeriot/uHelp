### A Peer-Based Mentorship Application for University Campuses

uHelp is a project currently under development at the University of Waterloo E^3 2016 Program. We intend to pair university students across their strengths and weaknesses to create an easier enviorment for students to access the help they need in areas such as academics, cooking, life skills and everything in-between.
